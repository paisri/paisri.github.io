The Phenomenological AI Safety Research Institute (**PAISRI**) exists to perform and encourage AI safety research using phenomenological methods. We believe this work is valuable because the the development of AGI (artificial general intelligence) creates existential risks for humanity, and AGI systems are likely to exhibit mental phenomena, so AI safety can best be approached using phenomenological methods that directly engage with the mental aspect of AGI. We are primarily focused on solving AGI alignment because we believe it offers the best long-term approach to building safe AI, but also consider issues of AI safety more generally.
